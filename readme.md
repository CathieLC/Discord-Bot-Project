# Discord bot Odysseus

The purpose of this project is to create and operate a Discord bot named Odysseus,
for my Wild Code School Data Analyst batch.

The short term goal is to provide quick access to useful resources dedicated to learning
Data Analytics.

Longer term development implies handling helper roles using reaction emojis.

This is a very early work in progress.
